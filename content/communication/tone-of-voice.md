<text-primary>

Our tone of voice must reflect who we are and the product we built. When we write this section, we look around and think about our colleagues; the people who brought you this platform.

How do they express themselves? What positive qualities do they have? What kind of words do they use?

We infer those traits into our tone of voice. That’s why when we write copy, we try to:

## Be Enthusiastic

Positivity brings joy to work. We see ourselves as a co-worker who injects fun and positive energy to work environment. A type of person people would like to work with daily.

**Example:**

**Let's train your bot!**<br />
Start by writing an example of how your users will express their intention, then tag it with the right label.

## Be Supportive

Acknowledge that failure happens to everyone. Instead of blaming, try to cheer people up and tell them what to do to fix the problem right away. Also, remember to congratulate every milestone people have achieved, even the smallest ones. The key to this is to understand people's struggles and desired outcomes. Give just enough information to let them get where they need to go.

**Example:**

**Cheers!**<br />
Congratulations on your first 1,000 sessions. Here’s to 1,000 more!

## Be Relatable

It doesn’t mean that we try to be people’s best friend. And it’s not just about showing some references about the latest trends. It’s about focusing on people’s actions, thoughts, and emotions. If we can do that, maybe they can feel our presence and be reminded that our platform is made for and by human.

**Examples:**

**Good to go!**<br />
(When number of monthly sessions remaining is >5000)

**Running low...**<br />
(When number of monthly sessions remaining is <5000, and >1000)

**...I don't feel so good...**<br />
(When number of monthly sessions remaining is <1000)
