Since its inception in 2016, Kata.ai has put a strong emphasis in its two core values: **Understanding Conversations** and **Humanizing Interactions**. We knew, without further elaboration, it may sound simply like a jargon.

**Aksara** is our attempt to translate those values into a set of design principles. It is instilled to how we design and communicate our product. It helps us bring clarity in uncertainty, provide confidence in doubt, and eventually helps us make better judgments in our design process. It becomes our north star to what a great platform should be.

The birth of **Aksara** brings us closer to our ultimate goal: Improving the way humans can collaborate with technology, so they can be more productive and empowered.
