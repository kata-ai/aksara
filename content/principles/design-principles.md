## Nail the Basics

One of our missions is to simplify chatbot development process. That’s why we keep going back to the drawing board to make sure the fundamentals of our platform works and feels even better. Every design decision is justified by this principle before moving to everything else.

## Clarity over Elegance

Our design must prioritize performance and purpose over looks and appearance. We don’t design to entertain, because people come to our platform to work. It is imperative that our design doesn’t take the attention away from what really matters: **helping people get their job done**.

## Relevance over Consistency

Don't take this as a license to break the rules whenever you'd like. This simply means that putting a limit to ideas, observations, and feedbacks only to be consistent doesn’t conform with reality. Ditch consistency if it was more relevant to the usability & context.

## Ever-Evolving

We adopt the mindset that everything is a work in progress. We encourage ourselves to never be content with the way things are; to continually strive to make things better. We believe excellence can be obtained on the first attempt, but if it isn't, one should keep pursuing it.

## Lasting Impression

We believe paying attention to the tiniest details have a huge impact to user experiences. We take microinteraction as serious as the bigger one. After all, what separates the best from the ordinary is finer details.
