**wicara /wi·ca·ra/ noun**<br />
is a series of voices in a language used to communicate words and sentences.

Wicara (previously kata-kit) is an implementation of Aksara using the React framework. It is the true implementation of Aksara in raw code form, designed to communicate with users and bring delightful experiences. Wicara is the designation for Aksara React components.

We documented Wicara (beta) using Storybook, The UI Development Environment. Check this link to find out more about Wicara: https://wicara-storybook.netlify.com/

The Modal and Drawer components have been updated with much-needed accessibility improvements:

- **Made modal/drawer closable by pressing the escape button.** This is crucial for easy access for people with no access to a mouse.
- **Used correct ARIA roles/attributes.**
- **Trap focus inside the modal/drawer.** This traps focus inside the modal/drawer when switching between elements inside the modal/drawer with the Tab key.
