**Wicara 0.7**, codenamed ["Madeline"](https://celestegame.wikia.com/wiki/Madeline), is the new beta release for Wicara. In this release, we're focusing on including some new components, bug fixes, as well as many architectural improvements.

- **Upgraded to styled-components v4.0.** Styled-components v4.0 introduced a lot of changes and new features. We will upgrade Wicara to this version to make use of these new features, as well as to prepare for further architectural improvements.
- **Refactored theme variables.** Rewrote theme + resets due to the changes in typings for `styled-components` v4. Implemented `createGlobalStyle` as global resets. Renamed variables to be more structured.
- **Cleaned up Layout styles.** This cleans up the layout styles further and brings the styles from our main platform to here. Also added an `<AppRoot />` component, which aliases the new `<Wrapper />` component for backwards compatibility.
- **Added Skeleton component.** This displays a placeholder elements for stuff still loading. Currently only supports loading texts, but in future release we'll add support for images.
- **New starter kit!** [Clone the starter kit here](https://github.com/kata-ai/wicara-starter) for a quickstart on building apps with Wicara.
